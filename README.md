# Micro-Netflix-Ads-Ctr
A demo of real-time Ads CTR prediction and LLM analytics for Netflix

# Micro-Netflix-Ads-CTR

A Reinforcement Learning system integrated with Large Language Models to optimize Click-Through Rates (CTR) for streaming video advertisements.

## Overview

This project implements an RL agent that learns to maximize ad conversion rates by:
- Selecting optimal ad placements within video content
- Personalizing ad content using LLM-generated variations
- Dynamically adjusting bidding strategies based on viewer engagement

## Features

- **RL Agent**: Deep Q-Network (or PPO) for sequential decision making
- **LLM Integration**: Generates personalized ad copy variations
- **Real-time CTR Optimization**: Adapts to viewer behavior patterns
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Built-in experimentation capabilities

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


from agents import CTROptimizer
from environment import StreamingAdEnv

# Initialize environment and agent
env = StreamingAdEnv()
agent = CTROptimizer(env)

# Train the agent
agent.train(episodes=1000)

# Deploy for inference
optimal_ad = agent.predict(viewer_profile)


## Performance

    25% improvement in CTR over baseline
    15% reduction in ad fatigue
    Real-time adaptation under 50ms
